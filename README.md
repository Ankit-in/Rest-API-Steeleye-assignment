# Rest-API-Steeleye-assignment
Technologies use: python , uvicorn , fastapi.

In this project i tried to insert data using fastapi framwork using python 
in which i used uvicorn
Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.
Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application interface for async frameworks. The ASGI specification fills this gap, and means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling usable across all async frameworks.
i used python for database entry and used for get,put,delete,post etc
after adding these all models.py for adding structure to the databases
and with the help of these used to fetch data from the databases
after ruing it automaticaly create link:http://localhost:8000 : by which you can able to see the databases
for visulization we cn use http://localhost:8000/docs
http://localhost:8000/redoc :for visulization
using docs we can also do the updation deletion and insertion
so here i done this all with little knowledge
hope it will help you to understand

thank you:)
steel eye
for giving me this opportunity
